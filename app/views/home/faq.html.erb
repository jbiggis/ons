<b>How does it work?</b>
<ol>
<li>Log in with Facebook.</li>
<li>Choose friends in your network whom you'd like to be 'friends with benefits' with.</li>
<li>If a friend chooses you back, you get notified.</li>
<li>Use a Key to reveal their identity and take the relationship to the next level.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<b>Will my friends know that I've chosen them as my "Friends with Benefits"?</b>
<p>No, your friends will not know that you chose them.  You identity will only be revealed to your friends when they also choose you as their "Friend with Benefits".</p>
</div>

<div class='separator'>
<b>What are Keys?</b>
<p>Whenever we find a match for you (i.e. you and your friend both choose each other as a Friend with Benefits), your friend is placed in the 'Your Friends with Benefits' box.</p>
<p>To reveal them, simply purchase Keys to unlock their identities.</p>

<b>Why do you need to collect my email address?</b>
<p>We need your email address to send you email notifications only. We will never spam or share your email address. </p>

<b>Why does it ask to 'access my data anytime' when I connect with Facebook?</b>
<p>We are using Facebook's 'Send Email Notifications' API to send emails, which requires offline access; otherwise, we won't be able to send you emails notifications when we match you up with your friends when you're offline.  We do not use that data for any other purposes, and we will not send you stuff that you don't want.</p>

<b>What are anonymous invites?</b>
<p>The more of your friends use friends-with-benefits.me, the higher the chance you get picked.</p>
<p>An anonymous invite allows you to send an email invitation to your friends to join friends-with-benefits.me without exposing your identity, so they will never know who invited them.</p>
