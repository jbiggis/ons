How does it work?
1. Pick friends in your network whom you'd be interested in being 'friends with benefits' with.
2. If a friend picks you back, we will send you both a notification email. Otherwise, your secrets will never be revealed.


How do I pick a friend?
1. Click on your friend you'd like to pick.
2. Confirm.


Why does it say "You don't have any Friends with Benefits yet" in the "My Friends with Benefits" section?
Your friend will only show up in the "My Friends with Benefits" section if you have both picked each other as Friends with Benefits, so the answer is simply:
1. He/She does not feel the same about you, (We're sorry about that...) or
2. He/She has not used this app yet. (Let him/her know about us by sharing on facebook!)


Is my friend going to know that I've picked him/her?
Your friend will NOT know that you've picked him/her unless he/she picks you back.  In which case, we will send you both a notification email letting you know the mutual feelings.


What is going to happen if my friend picks me back?
We will send you both a notification email letting you know the mutual feelings.


What is going to happen next?
Whatever happens next is up to the two of you! ;)


How do I get more Picks?
Click on one of the green "Get Picks" buttons. You will be redirected to Facebook to complete the transaction. (We currently only accept Facebook Credits as payment method.)


What is the difference between the two "Get Picks" buttons?
We currently have two options for you to get more Picks:
1. The green button on the left lets you get 5 Picks with 50 Facebook Credits,
2. For 100 Facebook Credits, we will give you 5 extra Picks for free, for a total of 15 Picks! Click on the green button on the right to get this offer.


How can I remove a friend that I've picked?
1. Click on the 'Show: Picks' link.
2. Click on the friend whom you'd like to remove.
3. Confirm. (Note: You will no longer receive notifications from this friend once he/she is removed, even if he/she picks you back in the future!)
