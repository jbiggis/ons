<b>How does it work?</b>
<ol>
<li>Log in with Facebook.</li>
<li>Pick friends in your network whom you'd be interested in being 'friends with benefits' with.</li>
<li>If a friend picks you back, we will send you both a notification email. Otherwise, your picks will never be revealed.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class='separator'>
<b>Why do you need to collect my email address?</b>
<p>We need your email address to send you email notifications when your friend picks you back as a Friend with Benefits.  Other than that, we will never spam or sell your email address. (<%=link_to "Privacy Policy", pp_path%>)</p>
</div>

<div class='separator'>
<b>Why do ask to 'access my data anytime' when I log in with Facebook?</b>
<p>We are using Facebook's 'Send Email Notifications' API to send emails, which requires offline access; otherwise, we won't be able to send you emails notifications when we match you up with your friends when you're offline.  We do not use that data for any other purposes, and we will not send you stuff that you don't want.</p>
</div>

<div class='separator'>
<b>How do I pick a friend?</b>
<ol>
<li>Click on your friend you'd like to pick.</li>
<li>Confirm.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<b>Why does it say "You don't have any Friends with Benefits yet" in the "My Friends with Benefits" section?</b>
<p>Your friend will only show up in the "My Friends with Benefits" section if you have both picked each other as Friends with Benefits. So it's either:</p>
<ul>
<li>your friend does not feel the same about you, or</li>
<li>your friend has not used the app yet, in which case you can try to get them to use it by <a class='link two' href='http://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=202763786417566&link=http://friends-with-benefits.me&picture=http://friends-with-benefits.me/images/fwb-icon.png&name=Friends%20with%20Benefits&caption=Friends-with-Benefits.me&description=Find%20out%20which%20of%20your%20friends%20wants%20you%20to%20be%20more%20than%20just%20a%20friend!&redirect_uri=http://friends-with-benefits.me'>sharing</a> it on your wall, or just telling them about it directly.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class='separator'>
<b>Is my friend going to know that I've picked him/her?</b>
<p>Your friend will NOT know that you've picked him/her unless he/she picks you back.  In which case, we will send you both a notification email.</p>
</div>

<div class='separator'>
<b>What is going to happen next?</b>
<p>That is beyond the value proposition of our service.</p>
